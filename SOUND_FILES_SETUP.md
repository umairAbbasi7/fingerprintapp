# Sound Files Setup

## Adding Sound Feedback to Fingerprint Capture

To enable sound feedback during the fingerprint capture process, add the following sound files to your project:

### Required Sound Files

1. **hold.mp3** - Played during the 3-second countdown
2. **captured.mp3** - Played when the image is successfully captured

### Installation Instructions

1. **Option 1: Assets Directory (Current Implementation)**
   ```
   app/src/main/assets/
   ├── hold.mp3
   └── captured.mp3
   ```

2. **Option 2: Raw Resources (Alternative)**
   ```
   app/src/main/res/raw/
   ├── hold.mp3
   └── captured.mp3
   ```

### Sound File Requirements

- **Format**: MP3
- **Duration**: 
  - `hold.mp3`: 1-2 seconds (countdown sound)
  - `captured.mp3`: 0.5-1 second (capture confirmation)
- **Quality**: 44.1kHz, 16-bit recommended

### Current Status

The app is currently configured to work **with or without** sound files:
- ✅ **With sound files**: Full audio feedback during capture
- ✅ **Without sound files**: Visual feedback only (countdown numbers, status messages)

### Testing

1. Add the sound files to `app/src/main/assets/`
2. Build and run the app
3. Test fingerprint capture - you should hear:
   - Hold sound during countdown (3, 2, 1)
   - Capture sound when image is taken

### Troubleshooting

If sounds don't play:
1. Check file format (must be MP3)
2. Verify file location (`app/src/main/assets/`)
3. Check device volume settings
4. Review logcat for sound initialization messages

The app will continue to work normally even if sound files are missing.
